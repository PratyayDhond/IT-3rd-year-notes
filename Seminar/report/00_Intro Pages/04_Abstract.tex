Flutter is a cross-platform User Interface development framework that is used
to develop cross platform applications using a single code base. Flutter can be
used to build beautiful, natively compiled application for various platforms such
as Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Linux, Web, etc. using a single codebase.

The key features of the Flutter Framework are Fast Development using the
Hot Reload, Expressive and Flexible User Interface(UI) and the Native Performance.

Fast Development : Flutter’s hot reload helps you quickly and easily experiment, build UIs, add features, and fix bugs faster. Experience sub-second reload
times without losing state on emulators, simulators, and hardware.

Expressive, beautiful UIs: Flutter comes with easy to build, highly customizable UI widgets which can be used for easy development. Flutter also supports custom widget building using other widgets.
Native Performance : Flutter’s widgets incorporate all critical platform
differences such as scrolling, navigation, icons and fonts to provide full native
performance on both iOS and Android.
